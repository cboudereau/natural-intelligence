# GitLab Review

Reference file of the [`code-review`](SKILL.md) skill. Read it when the review lives on
a GitLab merge request: reading threads, posting replies or suggestions, resolving
threads, or troubleshooting `glab`.

## Overview

GitLab-specific tooling for the review flow. It provides the `glab` commands and API
calls; the flow itself is not here.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** the [`code-review`](SKILL.md) skill defines the flow (read -> preview ->
approve -> post + resolve), the preview format, the Disposition rules, and the red
flags. Load it first. Git rules (push on request only, no force) are in the [`git-conventions`](../git-conventions/SKILL.md) skill.

## Reading the review

Find the merge request. With no id, `glab` uses the current branch's MR.

```bash
glab mr list --reviewer=@me            # MRs waiting on me
glab mr list --author=@me              # my own MRs
glab mr view <iid> --unresolved        # human-readable open threads
```

Get structured discussions, which is what to work from:

```bash
# All unresolved diff comments with file, line, author, body and discussion id
glab mr note list <iid> -F json --state unresolved --type diff \
  --jq '.[] | {id, notes: [.notes[] | {author: .author.username, body,
        file: .position.new_path, line: .position.new_line,
        old_line: .position.old_line}]}'

glab mr note list <iid> -F json --state unresolved --type general   # non-diff comments
glab mr note list <iid> --file <path>                               # threads on one file
```

Keep the full `id` of each discussion: it is what `--reply` targets. Human-readable
output truncates it to the first eight characters, which `--reply` also accepts.

For diff context:

```bash
glab mr diff <iid>
glab mr view <iid> -F json --jq '.diff_refs'   # base_sha, head_sha, start_sha
```

In the preview, **File:line** is `new_path:new_line` and **Discussion** is the
eight-character id prefix.

## Suggestion syntax

GitLab applies a fenced `suggestion` block when the note is attached to the diff.
The range is relative to the commented line:

- `suggestion:-0+0` replaces the commented line only
- `suggestion:-1+2` replaces one line above through two lines below

Rules:
- The block content is the final code, with the file's real indentation, and no diff markers.
- Suggestions work on diff notes only. A general MR comment cannot carry an applicable suggestion.
- A reply inside a diff thread can carry a suggestion; it applies to that thread's line.

## Posting after approval

Two writes per approved `reply + resolve` thread, in this order. A thread is not done
after the reply.

**1. Reply** inside the reviewer's own thread, which is the default choice:

```bash
glab mr note create <iid> --reply <discussion-id> -m "$(cat body.md)"
```

Start a new inline thread when there is no existing discussion on that line:

```bash
glab mr note create <iid> --file src/Domain/Booking.cs --line 42 -m "$(cat body.md)"
glab mr note create <iid> --file src/Domain/Booking.cs --line 40:44 -m "$(cat body.md)"  # range
glab mr note create <iid> --file src/Domain/Booking.cs --old-line 42 -m "..."            # removed line
```

Write the body to a file first with a heredoc, because fenced blocks and backticks do
not survive inline shell quoting. `--file`, `--reply` and `--unique` are mutually
exclusive, so a reply cannot carry `--unique`: to stay idempotent on a retry, re-read
the thread and skip the ones that already have your note.

**2. Resolve** the thread. `glab` has no resolve verb, so go through the API — the
discussion id is the same one `--reply` took:

```bash
glab api --method PUT "projects/<project-id>/merge_requests/<iid>/discussions/<discussion-id>?resolved=true"
```

Get `<project-id>` once with `glab repo view -F json --jq .id`, or use the URL-encoded
path (`d-edge%2F...`). Requires the full discussion id, not the eight-character prefix.

**3. Verify** before reporting, as the [`code-review`](SKILL.md) skill requires:

```bash
glab mr note list <iid> -F json --jq '[.[] | {id, resolved: ([.notes[] | select(.system==false) | .resolved] | any)}]'
```

## Setup

`glab` lives at `~/.local/bin/glab`. Check auth with `glab auth status`. On failure,
tell the user to run `glab auth login --hostname gitlab.com --stdin` with a personal
access token scoped `api`; do not attempt to create or read tokens.
